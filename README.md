#  BiographyAppSwiftUI - A BioGraphy App using SwiftUI

## Features
1. Auto fill random words
2. Word count indicator
3. SwiftUI
4. Solid Principles

## Requirements

**iOS 14.0+ / macOS 10.14.4
**Xcode 12+
**Swift 5+

 ## Architecture
 
 ** We have used MVVM Architecture. Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern. MVVM facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from development of the business logic or back-end logic (the data model).

## Swift UI
SwiftUI is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift. Build user interfaces for any Apple device using just one set of tools and APIs. With a declarative Swift syntax that’s easy to read and natural to write, SwiftUI works seamlessly with new Xcode design tools to keep your code and design perfectly in sync. Automatic support for Dynamic Type, Dark Mode, localization, and accessibility means your first line of SwiftUI code is already the most powerful UI code you’ve ever written.

## Components
### Views
1. ContentView

### ViewModel
ViewModel interacts with model and also prepares observable(s) that can be observed by a View. One of the important implementation strategies of this layer is to decouple it from the View, i.e, ViewModel should not be aware about the view who is interacting with.



### Solid Principle
While SOLID might be old (at least in internet years), they're one of those evergreen pieces of advice that go beyond language or platform specifics. SOLID is an acronym that stands for five guiding principles for OOP programming.

Single Responsibility Principle
Open/closed Principle
Liskov Substitution Principle
Interface Segregation Principle
Dependency Inversion Principle
